        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          The Beatles, an iconic English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960,
          consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo
          Starr. They are regarded as the most influential band of all time.
          Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock ‘n’ roll, their sound
          incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in
          innovative ways. The Beatles revolutionized the music industry,
          evolving from their early days playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg
          to achieving international stardom.
        </p>
        <h3>Their hits</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            "With a Little Help from My Friends”: Originally sung by Ringo
            Starr, this track from the “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band”
            album became a massive hit when Joe Cocker covered it in 1968.
          </li>
          <li>
            "Magical Mystery Tour”: Written mainly by Paul McCartney, this
            whimsical song was part of the “Magical Mystery Tour” soundtrack. It
            captures the psychedelic spirit of the times.
          </li>
          <li>
            “Yellow Submarine”: A children’s song written by Lennon and
            McCartney for the “Revolver” album, it later inspired an animated
            movie of the same name.
          </li>
          <li>
            “Free as a Bird”: In 1994, the surviving Beatles reunited to finish
            three John Lennon demos. This Jeff Lynne-produced track was their
            first new release in over two decades.
          </li>
          <li>
            “Day Tripper”: Written mainly by John Lennon, this catchy tune
            became the band’s third Christmas number one in 1965.
          </li>
          <li>
            “A Hard Day’s Night”: Featured in the iconic movie of the same name,
            this track primarily written by Lennon remains a classic.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          On January 30, 1969, the Beatles performed an impromptu concert from
          the rooftop of their Apple Corps headquarters at 3 Savile Row in
          central London. Joined by guest keyboardist Billy Preston, the band
          played a 42-minute set before the Metropolitan Police arrived and
          ordered them to reduce the volume. It was the final public performance
          of their career. Crowds of onlookers, many on lunch breaks,
          congregated in the streets and on nearby rooftops to listen. The
          concert ended with “Get Back,” and John Lennon humorously quipped,
          “I’d like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves, and I
          hope we’ve passed the audition.” The entire performance was filmed and
          recorded, appearing in the 1970 documentary film “Let It Be” and the
          2021 documentary series “The Beatles: Get Back”.

        <h2>Curiosities</h2>
        <div class="funfacts">
          <h4>Origins of the Name:</h4>
          <p>
            The band was originally called the "Quarrymen" and later "Johnny and
            the Moondogs" before settling on "The Beatles." The name was a
            playful combination of "beat" from beat music and "beetle".
          </p>
          <h4>Album Cover Innovations:</h4>
          <p>
            The cover of their iconic album "Abbey Road" was taken on a zebra
            crossing outside Abbey Road Studios in London. The image of the band
            walking across the street has become one of the most famous album
            covers in history.
          </p>
          <h4>Ed Sullivan Show Impact:</h4>
          <p>
            The Beatles' first live appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964
            is considered a milestone in American pop culture history. Over 73
            million people tuned in to watch, making it one of the highest
            viewership figures for an American television program at the time.
          </p>
          <h4>Hidden Messages in Record Labels:</h4>
          <p>
            On the label of the "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" album,
            if you play the song "A Day in the Life" backwards, you can hear a
            hidden message. When played in reverse, John Lennon says, "We'll
            fuck you like Superman."
          </p>
          <h4>Fifth Beatle Contenders:</h4>
          <p>
            Over the years, several people have been considered the "Fifth
            Beatle" due to their close association with the band, including
            manager Brian Epstein, producer George Martin, and even musician
            Billy Preston, who played with the band on several tracks.
          </p>
          <h4>Bizarre Fan Requests:</h4>
          <p>
            The Beatles received some strange fan mail and requests, including a
            proposal from a fan who offered to have all her teeth removed and
            sent to the band members as a token of her love.
